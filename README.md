# Fake Email Detector Using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect fake emails. It uses a variety of preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and a logistic regression model for classification.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.
1. Loading dataset
2. Handling missing values
3. Inspecting the dataset
4. Encoding 'Category' column
5. Extracting features and labels
6. Splitting the dataset
7. Transforming text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer
8. Encoding target labels
9. Training the Logistic Regression model
10. Evaluating model accuracy
11. Predicting new data


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.

### Running the Project

1. Replace any missing values in the dataset with empty strings.
2. Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and size.
3. Encode the 'Category' column to convert categorical values to numerical values.
4. Extract features and labels from the dataset.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Transform text data into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
7. Encode the target labels as numerical values.
8. Train the Logistic Regression model on the training data.
9. Evaluate the model's accuracy on both the training and testing data.
10. Predict the category of a new email message using the trained model.
